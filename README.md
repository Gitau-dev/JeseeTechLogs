Documenting my journey to becoming a Linux System Administrator

Welcome to my Linux + System Admin practice log. I'm using this space to grow my command-line, user management, and infrastructure skills — one day at a time.

## lesson 1 — Command Mastery

** Goal**: Practice file and directory commands  
** Setup**:
- Created `sysadmin_practice/` folder
- Added `logs/`, `configs/`, `users/`, and `archive/`
- Created sample config files, logs, and moved them around
- Learned how to log my command history
- Practiced capturing and organizing my terminal output

 Commands saved to: `logs/command_log.txt`
